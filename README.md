# recommender-system

These are the recommender systems learned from STAT3009 which mainly focus on neural network and matrix factorisation. 
K-fold CV, multi-perceptron and different numerical optimization methods are used in the program.

## Project 1
We have `user_id` and `item_id` to predict the rating of each users to each items.

## Project 2
We have not only `user_id` and `item_id` but also the `genre` of each items and the users rating date `date`.
In addition to these essentials, there is an dataset of user social network which have also taken into account to create graphs.
